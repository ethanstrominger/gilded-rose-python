# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

I translated the original C# into a few other languages, (with a little help from my friends!), and slightly changed the starting position. This means I've actually done a small amount of refactoring already compared with the original form of the kata, and made it easier to get going with writing tests by giving you one failing unit test to start with. I also added test fixtures for Text-Based approval testing with TextTest (see [the TextTests](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests))

As Bobby Johnson points out in his article ["Why Most Solutions to Gilded Rose Miss The Bigger Picture"](http://iamnotmyself.com/2012/12/07/why-most-solutions-to-gilded-rose-miss-the-bigger-picture), it'll actually give you
better practice at handling a legacy code situation if you do this Kata in the original C#. However, I think this kata
is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that. I think it's also interesting to compare what the refactored code and tests look like in different programming languages.

I wrote this article ["Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/) about how you could use this kata in a [coding dojo](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).

## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. You'll want to look at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) which explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a popular test framework as a starting point for most languages.

Alternatively, use the "Text-Based" tests provided in this repository. (Read more about that in the next section)

Whichever testing approach you choose, the idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design. 

## Text-Based Approval Testing

This code comes with comprehensive tests that use this approach. For information about how to run them, see the [texttests README](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests)

## Get going quickly using Cyber-Dojo

I've also set this kata up on [cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org) for several languages, so you can get going really quickly:

To create an *individual* exercise:
- [C#, NUnit](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_individual/Fz4xFX?index=3)
- [C++ (g++), GoogleTest](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_individual/qPPrZy?index=7)
- [Java, Cucumber](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_individual/SvUf30?index=2) - for this one I've also written some step definitions for you
- [Java, JUnit](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_individual/aJJEN4?index=2)
- [Python, unittest](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_individual/NFgFys?index=2)
- [Ruby, RSpec](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_individual/D3xbUV?index=3)
- [Ruby, testunit](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_individual/zlElgj?index=9)

To create a *group* exercise:
- [C#, NUnit](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_group/Fz4xFX?index=3)
- [C++ (g++), GoogleTest](https://cyber-dojo.org/forker/fork_group/qPPrZy?index=7)

## Better Code Hub

I analysed this repo according to the clean code standards on [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) just to get an independent opinion of how bad the code is. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the compliance score is low!

=======
Modified by me from the original, found at https://github.com/istepaniuk/gilded-rose-js-with-tests, in the following ways:

1. It's in Python 3 now.  So, really the only original content is the last half of this README

## Installing

Clone the repo and cd to the project directory.
Make sure you have nodejs >= 6 installed

```bash
npm install -g yarn
npm install
```

## Running the tests
```bash
yarn test                   \\ run once
yarn test:watch             \\ run in watch mode
yarn test:watch:coverage    \\ run in watch mode with coverage reports
```


Coding Dojo
===========

Note that this Kata has been slightly modified from [the original](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/) by Terry Hughes and Bobby Johnson. Namely, in the original Kata the Brie Cheese does not behave exactly like the Backstage passes as this code does. I also think the original kata has a bug on purpose so you have to fix it. This version was used in the Madrid Software Craftsmanship meetup group, and we wanted to focus on refactoring. We had limited time, so the tests are already written and green. [This is a post in my blog about that meeting.](http://blog.istepaniuk.com/refactoring-dojo-the-gilded-rose-kata)

Gilded Rose
===========
Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. 
As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison.
We also buy and sell only the finest goods.

Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. 

It was developed by a guy named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:

 - All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item.
 - All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is.
 - At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item.

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

 - Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast.
 - The Quality of an item is never negative.
 - "Aged Brie" increases in Quality the older it gets.
 - The Quality of an item is never more than 50, but "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and as such its Quality is always 80 and it never alters.
 - "Backstage passes", like "Aged Brie", increases by one in Quality as its SellIn date approaches
     - Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less 
     - Quality increases by 3 when there are 5 days or less 
     - Quality drops to 0 after the concert

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires AN UPDATE to our system:

 - "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we'll cover for you.)

Your work needs to be completed by 20:00hs.

Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50.
